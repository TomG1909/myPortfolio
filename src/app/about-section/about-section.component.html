        <h2>About me</h2><div id="about"></div>
        <p> I started my IT journey coding small websites during my studies. Although my career path didn't lead me directly to IT, I never lost my interest for building websites and web applications. Finally, I took the chance to follow my passion for IT
            after joining the Developer Akademie, a professional coding academy. Now I am looking forward to interesting and challenging projects.
